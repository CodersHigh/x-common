못 하나가 없어서, 말편자가 망가졌네.
말편자가 없어서, 말이 다쳤네.
말이 다쳐서, 기사가 부상당했네.
기사가 부상당해, 전투에서 졌네.
전투에서 져서, 나라가 망했네.
모든게 말편자의 못이 없었기 때문이야.

For want of a nail the shoe was lost.
For want of a shoe the horse was lost.
For want of a horse the rider was lost.
For want of a rider the message was lost.
For want of a message the battle was lost.
For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.
And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.
